The incredible turnout of the 6/14/25 No Kings protests demonstrate that there is a huge amount of anger and angst with the Trump Administration among the American people. I think most estimates put turnout at around 2-3% of the population. Great, but not not the ~5% needed to affect real political change. I think bringing more people into the movement is incredibly important, and have some ideas about how to do that. But, I think it is not worth mobilizing people with no clear goals. No Kings, according to its website, was centered around three ideas:

Trump is using million so tax dollars to do his birthday/army’s birthday military parade
Trump has said multiple times he wants to run for an unconstitutional third term
The Trump administration has been lawless
 All of these things are true, but these are not goals, just statements of fact. So, what should a modern anti-Trump 2.0 movement be asking for? How do we coalesce a singular message and what should that message be? 

My answer is Resignation and Prosecution.

We should be calling for the resignation of all members of the federal government who have enabled the most egregious law breaking and American-power destroying policies of the Trump 2.0 administration. We should call for prosecution of those who gave illegal orders, and those who followed them. We must be a nation of laws. We must be understand that the government is not the law, but subject to them.

**1. Donald Trump:** We call on you to resign. For being mentally and physically unable to perform the job of the president, for being a felon, for dividing the country, for putting your own personal wealth and power before our country, for sullying our reputation in the world, for being a pathological liar, for enabling and promoting hatred. For rampant corruption.

**2. JD Vance:** We call on you to resign. For giving white supremacy a voice in the deepest parts of the federal government, for lying to the american people, time and time again, for being craven to billionaires who explicitly want to end democracy. For rampant corruption.

**3. Stephen Miller:** We call on you to resign. For giving white supremacy a voice in the deepest parts of the federal government, for lying to the american people, time and time again. For terrorizing the most vulnerable, for ordering people to break the law.

**4. Kristi Noem:** We call on you to resign. For making our country less safe. For breaking the law and ordering people to break the law. For terrorizing legal immigrants. For ignoring court orders. For lying to the American people. For taking pleasure in the torture of innocent people. For violating due process over and over again. For putting yourself before the constitution. For rampant corruption.

**5. Pete Hegseth:** We call on you to resign. For making our country less safe. For wasting billions of dollars on a failed war in Yemen. For unleashing more wars on the world. For being mentally and physically unable to perform the job of the Secretary of Defense. For lying to the American people, time and time again. For putting yourself before the constitution. For rampant corruption.

**6. Marco Rubio:** We call on you to resign. For making our country less safe. For lying to the American people, time and time again. For sullying our reputation in the world. For putting yourself before the constitution. For allowing the illegal destruction of USAID, and other federal agencies that serve the neediest in the country and the world. For the deaths of hundreds of thousands of the most vulnerable in the world. For rampant corruption.

**7. RFK Jr.:** We call on you to resign. For making our country less safe. For lying to the American people, time and time again. For destroying our health infrastructure. For destroying the crown jewels of the federal government: research and human health. For promoting eugenics. For rampant corruption.

**8. Karoline Leavitt**: We call on you to resign. For lying to the American people over and over. For promoting white supremacy. For being anti-democracy. For rampant corruption.

**9. Russel Vought:** We call on you to resign. For lying to the American people. For ignoring the rule of law. For putting your ideology before the constitution. For breaking the law and ordering people to break the law.

**10. Sam Alito:**  We call on you to resign. For rampant corruption. For twisting the constitution to sanction whatever the Trump administration wants to do. For overturning years of precedent to enable even more corruption.

**11. Clarence Thomas:** We call on you to resign. For rampant corruption. For twisting the constitution to sanction whatever the Trump administration wants to do. For overturning years of precedent to enable even more corruption.

What about Prosecution? It is essential that we hold people accountable for illegal acts. We must create new laws and new legal bodies to prosecute both those who gave illegal orders, and those who ignored the law once they were ruled illegal. Those who carried out those illegal orders should also be prosecuted. We have to make clear that employees of the federal government are held to the highest of standards, and those people who cannot resist illegal orders are not worthy of serving the people of the United States of America.

At the end of the day, the crisis we are going through is a crisis of accountability. We must restore accountability in the strongest possible ways to survive as a democracy, as a united people, and as leaders of the free world.
