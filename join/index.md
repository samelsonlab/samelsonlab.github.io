We are always in the market for motivated and talented people, even if we do not have an open position currently advertised. We are interested in engaging with you in a conversation about your scientific background and goals for your future career (in academia, industry, or other ventures). We strive to provide excellent training across a wide range of computational and experimental techniques. If interested please send your CV/Resume to [Dr. James Fraser](/contact).

Currently we are hiring at all **positions**:
[Specialist](https://aprecruit.ucsf.edu/JPF03325) who will engage in research projects and also manage daily wet lab operations. -->

## Graduate Students

At UCSF, students can apply to a single [graduate program](https://graduate.ucsf.edu/programs) and do not apply directly to labs. The landscape of life science PhD programs and their admissions processes can be incredibly opaque, so Hersh Bhargava and I wrote a [guide on Applying to Quantitative Biology PhD Programs](https://hershbhargava.com/writing/applying-to-phd-programs/). 

##### The Samelson Lab participates in the following UCSF graduate programs:
  * **[Biophysics](http://biophysics.ucsf.edu/)**: The Biophysics Graduate Program (BP) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) prepares scientists to leverage new and emerging research tools—from nanotechnology to nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy—to quantify biological processes in living biological systems using physics and chemistry.
  * **[Chemistry and Chemical Biology](http://ccb.ucsf.edu/)**: The Chemistry and Chemical Biology Graduate Program (CCB) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) prepares scientists to address problems at the intersection of chemistry and biology by providing a chemical foundation for understanding complex biological processes at an atomic level.
  * **[Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacogenomics](http://pspg.ucsf.edu/)**: The Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacogenomics (PSPG) Graduate Program at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) focuses on how to develop effective drug therapies for patients that have a minimum of adverse effects.
  * **[Tetrad](http://tetrad.ucsf.edu/)**: The Tetrad graduate program offers diverse training in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, Developmental Biology, & Genetics.

Once students are admitted to UCSF, during the first year of a Ph.D. program, students rotate through ~3 labs prior to deciding on a thesis lab. Our lab is usually open for rotation students every quarter and will generally have room for 1-2 new graduate students (regardless of program affiliation) per year.

As the 3rd rotation period comes to a close, we will talk with the year's rotation students (at least those who remain interested!) about joining the lab.  During this period, we encourage students to keep talking to the PI and lab members about what kind of project they might want to shape. We consider project fit, scientific chemistry, and alignment with lab values. Because we are a member of multiple graduate programs with different policies and timings for final lab decision making, we cannot make any final commitments until the end of the Spring Quarter to ensure all rotations students are given consideration.

## Postdoctoral Fellows

Inquiries about Postdoctoral positions should be emailed directly to [Dr. James Fraser](/contact). We set our postdoctoral fellow compensation to the [Stanford rates](https://postdocs.stanford.edu/funding-levels-and-guidelines) **and** encourage candidates to explore applying for extramural fellowships to support their research.

## Other Visitors

In the past, our lab has enjoyed having foreign exchange students, interns, sabbatical visitors from academia and industry, and post-bac research specialists in the lab.  We are open to other arrangements as well. As we expect people to be fairly compensated for their work by their home institution or by us, we do not have volunteer positions available. 

**We take high school students exclusively through UCSF affiliated programs, e.g. [SEP](http://sep.ucsf.edu/), [BAYS](https://pharm.ucsf.edu/bays).** We cannot accomodate high school students outside of these programs and do not have volunteer positions for high school students.
