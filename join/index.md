We are always in the market for motivated and talented people, even if we do not have an open position currently advertised. We are interested in engaging with you in a conversation about your scientific background and goals for your future career (in academia, industry, or other ventures). We strive to provide excellent training across a wide range of computational and experimental techniques. If interested please send your CV/Resume to [Dr. Avi Samelson](/contact).

## Graduate Students

At UCLA, students can apply to a single [graduate program](https://grad.ucla.edu/) and do not apply directly to labs. The landscape of life science PhD programs and their admissions processes can be incredibly opaque, so Hersh Bhargava and Jaime Fraser wrote a [guide on Applying to Quantitative Biology PhD Programs](https://hershbhargava.com/writing/applying-to-phd-programs/) that has some good information. 

##### The Samelson Lab participates in the following UCLA graduate programs:
  * **[Neuroscience](https://neuroscience.ucla.edu/)**: The UCLA Neuroscience Interdepartmental Program (NSIDP) strives to give its students the necessary tools and perspectives to become leaders in Neuroscience related disciplines. NSIDP succeeds through a didactic curriculum, individualized advising and strong focus on career development. The major focus of the program is on neuroscience related biomedical research at the basic and translational level.
  * **[Molecular Biology Interdepartmental Doctoral Program](https://www.mbi.ucla.edu/mbidp)**: The Molecular Biology Interdepartmental Doctoral Program (MDIDP) provides cutting-edge education and hands-on training in Molecular Regulatory Mechanisms that are shared across organisms and are common within a broad range of disciplines. The philosophy of the program stands on the concept that depth within a specialty and interdisciplinary breadth are critical to shape the minds of the future generations of scientific leaders and develop independent thinkers.
  * **[Biochemistry, Molecular, and Cell Biology](https://bmsb.chem.ucla.edu/)**: The Biochemistry, Molecular, and Cell Biology Program (BMCB) in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry offers a long-standing tradition of excellence in research and PhD student training. It is well-suited for students interested in biological systems and molecules, particularly those who seek a detailed, mechanistic understanding of biological and biochemical phenomena. ​​

## Postdoctoral Fellows

Inquiries about Postdoctoral positions should be emailed directly to [Dr. Avi Samelson](/contact). We set our postdoctoral fellow compensation to the [Stanford rates](https://postdocs.stanford.edu/funding-levels-and-guidelines) **and** encourage candidates to explore applying for extramural fellowships to support their research.

Currently we are hiring at **all positions!!**
