description: "I graduated from Colgate University with a double major in biochemistry and computer science. 
My research experience involves studying sex differences in the molecular network of the heart, 
organic synthesis of a Tn antigen to be used for cancer immunotherapies, and identifying cancer-
associated peptides that can act as neoantigens. Through these experiences, I became interested 
in identifying molecular tools and pathways to address heterogeneous diseases. To that end, I 
enjoy generating and processing large data sets and leveraging computational techniques, such as
ML. I am now a BBSB student and am currently rotating in the lab. To directly link genotype to 
phenotype, my project in the lab revolves around setting up a cDNA display for tau and α-
synuclein. With their sequences attached to them, we can easily determine how the sequence 
affects aggregation capacity. Outside of the lab, I enjoy drawing, gaming, and exploring LA."
