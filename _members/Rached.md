description: "Sandra recently earned her Bachelor's degree in Pharmacology from [UCSB](https://undergrad.biology.ucsb.edu/majors/pharmacology). During undergrad, she worked in drug development and quality control at [Vascular Biosciences](https://vascularbiosciences.com/). There, her research focused on developing and optimizing a peptide-conjugated liposome drug delivery system that preferentially targets diseased tissues in pulmonary hypertension. In the Samelson lab, Sandra is responsible for lab management and molecular and cell biology experiments, and is currently working on a project involving a gene expression system for human iPSC-derived neurons. Outside of the lab, Sandra likes hiking, cooking, sewing, and vintage shopping."
