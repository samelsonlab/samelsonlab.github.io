description: "I graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park with a double major B.S. in Biochemistry and Psychology. After graduation, I worked in Dr. Hui Zhang’s lab at Johns Hopkins University, where my research focused on developing new bottom-up mass spectrometry workflows and computational platforms for proteoform quantification.
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Molecular Biology Interdepartmental Doctoral Program at the University of California, Los Angeles. During my Winter 2026 rotation in the Samelson Lab, I am investigating how methionine oxidation influences tau fragmentation, seeding, and aggregation in neurodegenerative disease.
Outside the lab, I enjoy playing video games, golfing, and composing music."
