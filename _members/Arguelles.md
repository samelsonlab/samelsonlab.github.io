description: "I attended University of California, Berkeley for my undergraduate studies, where I majored in Molecular and Cell Biology with an emphasis in Neurobiology. I was an honors undergraduate student researcher at the Noah Whiteman Lab, where I completed my honors thesis. Upon graduation, I moved to Boston, MA to study the role of DNA methylation in promoting carcinogenesis in a pre leukemic model under the mentorship of Drs. Bradley Bernstein and Alba Rodriguez-Meira as a research technician at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
Now, I am in the Molecular Biology Interdepartmental Doctoral Program at University of California, Los Angeles, rotating in the Samelson Lab to study the cell-specific selective vulnerabilities of neurons in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease. In my free time, I love to dance, check out new restaurants and bars, and spend time outdoors."
