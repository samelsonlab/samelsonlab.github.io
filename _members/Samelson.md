description: "Avi is originally from Berkeley, CA. He was an undergraduate at Northwestern University where he worked with [Dr. Alfonso Mondrag√≥n](https://groups.molbiosci.northwestern.edu/mondragon/). During the summers he worked in the lab of [Dr. Tom Alber](http://fraserlab.com/2014/04/04/Tom-Alber/) with [Dr. James Fraser](https://fraserlab.com/) to study how to [access protein conformational ensembles using room temperature x-ray crystallography](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21918110/).


He began graduate school in 2011 to do his Ph.D. in the Department of [Molecular and Cellular Biology at UC Berkeley](http://mcb.berkeley.edu). There, he worked with  [Dr. Susan Marqusee](https://zebra.berkeley.edu/) and created new methods to characterize the [thermodynamics](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27821780/), [kinetics](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32527724/), and [folding trajectories](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29854950/) of ribosome nascent chains.


In 2017, Avi started his postdoc in [Dr. Martin Kampmann](https://kampmannlab.ucsf.edu)'s lab at UCSF in the [Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases](https://ind.ucsf.edu/). There, he created new technologies for antibody-based genetic modifier screens in differentiated cell types with a focus on understanding how neurons control the protein aggregation trajectory of tau. Avi discovered new principles of tau proteostasis in neurons, including a new tau E3 ubiquitin ligase and a connection between oxidative stress and tau proteasomal (mis)processing. He also led a project that discovered novel regulators of the SARS-CoV-2 host receptor ACE2.

Avi started his lab at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/) as an Assitant Professor in the [Department of Neurology](https://www.uclahealth.org/departments/neurology) with a secondary affiliation in [Biological Chemistry](https://biolchem.ucla.edu/) in January of 2025. The lab is focused on characterizing protein aggregation trajectories and how cells control those trajectories."
