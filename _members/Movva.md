description: "I graduated from UC San Diego in 2023 with a major in Biochemistry and a minor in Bioethics. My love for research and curiosity about disease mechanisms began as an undergrad in the Debelouchina lab where I studied how tau interacts with heterochromatin. After graduating, I spent a year in industry at Biolegend on the quality control team where I validated antibodies using Western blots. Now, I’m a graduate student in UCLA’s Molecular Biology Institute in the Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology (BBSB) home area. As a rotation student, I’m investigating different approaches to studying Alzheimer’s Disease, with a strong interest in using structural biology and biochemical techniques to build a solid foundation for my findings. Outside the lab, I love getting creative in the kitchen with cooking and baking, exploring new hiking trails, traveling to national parks, trying out new crafts, swimming at the beach, and gardening."
