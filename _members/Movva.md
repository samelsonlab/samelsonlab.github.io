description: "I graduated from UC San Diego in 2023 as a Biochemistry major and Bioethics minor. My love for neurodegeneration research began as an undergraduate in the Debelouchina Lab where I studied the protection ability of nuclear tau. After graduating, I spent a year in industry at Biolegend on the western blot quality control team. Now, I’m a PhD student in UCLA’s Molecular Biology Institute in the Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology (BBSB) program. I’m excited to integrate my interests of structural and molecular biology to answer key biological questions. My work in the Samelson Lab is focused on gaining a structural and mechanistic insight into a novel tau E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates neuronal tau levels. I hope to leverage this system to promote total tau clearance in neurons and develop early intervention strategies for Alzheimer’s disease. Outside of the lab, I love cooking and baking, visiting national parks, trying out new crafts, going to the beach, and gardening!"
