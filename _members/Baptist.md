description: "I am a junior who transferred to UCLA from Modesto Junior College, and I am majoring
in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. I was an undergraduate research
volunteer on the Design2Data project under UC Davis Siegel Labs, where I focused on
performing assays and point mutations on amino acids to optimize the β-Glucosidase B
gene’s function and stability. My current research focus is an emphasis on
neurodegenerative diseases and I hope to pursue an MD/PhD in the future. In the
Samelson lab, I will be helping support numerous projects in the lab, as well as cell
culturing, building mutant libraries, and working with iPSC-derived neurons. In my free
time, I enjoy going to the gym, playing cards, and listening to music!"
