description: "I graduated from Tufts University in 2024 with a double major in Biology and Chemistry. As an undergraduate in the Davis lab, I worked on synthesizing organometallic complexes for light-driven catalysis and energy capture. While this work deepened my appreciation for chemical design, I became increasingly interested in applying chemical tools to study complex biological systems. During my early rotations as a graduate student in the Chemistry & Biochemistry Department at UCLA, I explored how fluorescent probes could be used to monitor cellular responses to environmental stress in real time. This evolving interest ultimately drew me to the Samelson lab. As a rotation student, I am investigating how fluorescence-based reporters and genetic screening can be used to map stress-induced changes in protein homeostasis. I am particularly interested in how oxidative stress influences protein fragmentation and aggregation dynamics in neurodegenerative disease contexts, and how cells differentially regulate the fate of specific protein fragments under stress. Outside the lab, I enjoy crafting (especially with beads), spending time at local beaches, and exploring LAâ€™s food scene."
