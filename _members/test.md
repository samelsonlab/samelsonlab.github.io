description: "Willow graduated from the Evergreen State College with degrees in Chemistry and Environmental studies. As an undergraduate in [Dr. Anitra Ingalls’s](https://sites.google.com/view/anitra-ingalls) lab at the University of Washington, he studied how B vitamins mediate microbial interactions and diversity in the open ocean. For graduate school, Willow did his Ph.D. in [Dr. Daniel Schmidt’s](http://www.biologyplus.org) lab at the University of Minnesota, where he developed massively parallel sequencing-based methods to study and engineer membrane proteins proteins. Willow found mutational and insertional scanning methods can be useful for identifying regions of a protein involved in functionally meaningful conformational changes, developed mechanistic models for how to assemble protein domains to create useful multi-domain protein tools, and studied the evolution of ion channel regulation.


Near the end of his PhD, Willow moved to the SF Bay Area to be close to family for personal reasons and took up residence as a visitor in [Dr. James Fraser's](https://fraserlab.com) lab at UCSF. Within mere weeks the Covid pandemic struck leading Willow to become stuck in the Bay Area and was convinced to stick around for a bit longer at UCSF as an [HHMI Hanna Gray](https://www.hhmi.org/programs/hanna-h-gray-fellows-program#Fellows) and [QBI Fellow](https://fellows.ucsf.edu/current-fellows#:~:text=QBI%20Fellows%3A%20). In this role, Willow further developed mechanistic genetic screening approaches for studying how membrane proteins fold, traffic, function, and are regulated. This experience was a tremendous amount of fun and convinced both Willow and the UCSF community to make it an even longer term journey together when Willow was appointed as an Assistant Professor in Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences at UCSF.


Overall, Willow is inspired to develop a deep and comprehensive molecular, cellular, and physiological understanding for how membrane proteins allows us to interact with the world around us, how they break to cause the diseases that ail us, and how we can better treat these diseases with therapeutics. More broadly Willow wants to keep growing, learning, and having fun through the scientific endeavor!


Outside of lab Willow enjoys spending time with dear friends and family, creating and listening to music, enjoying and making delicious food, and meandering through nature."
