description: "I graduated from Boston University in 2025 with a major in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and a minor in Computer Science. I've previously done two summer internships at UCSF in the Cheng Lab, where I aimed to resolve the open conformation structure of the cold-sensing receptor TRPM8 as well as the human INO80 chromatin-remodeling complex using cryoEM. Back in Boston, I joined the Han Lab at BU’s Medical Campus, helping refine a live, intravascular imaging system to visualize blood clots in mice and explore how genetic changes affect thrombosis. I later moved to the Puigserver Lab at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where I characterized chaperones facilitating the mitochondrial protein import pathway.
I am very happy to now be a student in UCLA's MBI program under the BBSB home area. As a rotation student in the Samelson Lab, I am developing a high-throughput approach to distinguish structurally distinct amyloid fibrils using specialized dyes and spectral flow cytometry.
Outside of labwork, I love to dance, paint, and explore the many things LA has to offer with my friends."
