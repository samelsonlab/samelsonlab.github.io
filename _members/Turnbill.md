description: "Victoria earned a BA in Biological Sciences from Mt. Holyoke College in 2017 where she studied the evolutionary mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphism in the reproductive organs of various species in the lab of Dr. Patricia Brennan. She earned an MS in Biology in 2019 from Chatham University where she completed her thesis on sexual dimorphism in the fish genus Cyprinodon using geometric morphometrics in the lab of Dr. Michael Collyer. Victoria then spent 4 years as a research technologist at Johns Hopkins University in the lab of Dr. Frances Northington. Here, Victoria primarily studied neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in both wildtype mice and transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease using a variety of techniques including mouse behavior and cognitive testing, immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy, and much more. Since enrolling in the UCLA Interdepartmental PhD Program for Neuroscience in 2023, Victoria has rotated in the labs of Dr. Rhonda Voskuhl, Dr. Yirong Peng, and Dr. Lindsay De Biase. Now, as a rotating graduate student in the Samelson Lab, Victoria is expanding her skillset and focusing her interests in neurodegenerative disease, aging, and sexual dimorphism into a study of Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis at the cellular level. Outside the lab, Victoria enjoys hiking, weightlifting, archery, and lazy days at the beach."
