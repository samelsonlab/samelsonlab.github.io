description: "I grew up in Kathmandu, Nepal, and earned my BS in Microbiology from St. Xavier’s College. As an undergraduate, I worked on projects characterizing the antimicrobial properties of medicinal plants and conducted a study on the physicochemical and microbial analysis of the Bagmati River in Kathmandu valley. After graduating, I interned in the pathology department at Shahid Gangalal National Heart Center before beginning my PhD in Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences at the University of Wyoming in 2019. For my doctoral research in Dr. Thomas Boothby’s lab, I studied how the chemical environment influences the ensemble-function relationships of intrinsically disordered proteins during desiccation. Broadly, I’m interested in protein aggregation in the context of disease and development. As a postdoctoral scholar in the Samelson Lab, I will investigate how sequence and cellular factors drive the aggregation of amyloid-forming proteins, using biophysical and biochemical approaches both in vitro and in iPSC-derived neuronal models. I’m excited to work at the interface of protein biochemistry, biophysics, cell biology, and functional genomics. Outside the lab, I enjoy traveling, hiking, reading, watching soccer and cricket."
