The long-term goal of our research is to understand the large scale protein conformational changes that occur en route to protein aggregation– a protein’s aggregation trajectory– and how different cell types control those trajectories. We take a protein energy landscape view of protein folding and misfolding and combine it with systems genetics techniques to gain a comprehensive view of how neurons control protein aggregation trajectories. <br/> 
We are part of the [Department of Neurology](https://www.uclahealth.org/departments/neurology) with a secondary affiliation in the [Department of Biological Chemistry](https://biolchem.ucla.edu/). The lab will be opening in January 2025!
The mission of the Samelson lab is to provide a welcoming, inclusive, rigorous, and transparent environment for research and training. Read more about our lab [mission](/philosophy/mission) and [values](philosophy/values).
