# Welcome to the Samelson Lab!
{: .display-4}
<br>
We are part of the [Department of Neurology](https://www.uclahealth.org/departments/neurology) with a secondary affiliation with the [Department of Biological Chemistry](https://biolchem.ucla.edu/). The lab will be opening in January 2025

The mission of the Samelson lab is to provide a welcoming, inclusive, rigorous, and transparent environment for research and training. We want our lab members to feel the joy of scientific discovery and reach their full potential.

We study protein aggregation. Aggregation is a hallmark of many diseases, especially common neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.  The Samelson lab focuses on characterizing the conformational states a protein populates en route to its final aggregate state— a protein’s aggregation trajectory— and how cells control that trajectory. How do specific cellular gene expression programs decide a protein’s conformational fate? We combine biophysical characterization of key processes that control protein misfolding with systems-level approaches (like CRISPR-screening) to answer these questions.
