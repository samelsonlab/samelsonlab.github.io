The long-term goal of our research is to understand the large scale protein conformational changes that occur en route to protein aggregation– a protein’s aggregation trajectory– and how different cell types control those trajectories. We take a protein energy landscape view of protein folding and misfolding and use systems genetics techniques to gain a comprehensive view of how cells control protein aggregation trajectories. {: .welcomefont}
