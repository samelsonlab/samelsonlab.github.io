The long-term goal of our research is to understand the large scale protein conformational changes that occur en route to protein aggregation– a protein’s aggregation trajectory– and how different cell types control those trajectories. We take a protein energy landscape view of protein folding and misfolding and use systems genetics techniques to gain a comprehensive view of how cells control protein aggregation trajectories. 

We are part of the [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/) [David Geffen School of Medicine](https://medschool.ucla.edu/) [Department of Neurology](https://www.uclahealth.org/departments/neurology) with a secondary affiliation in the [Department of Biological Chemistry](https://biolchem.ucla.edu/). <br>
