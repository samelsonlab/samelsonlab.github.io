<!-- I am sure everyone has heard that the Trump Administration has frozen >$300 million worth of grant funding from the NSF, NIH, and DOE to UCLA. The pretext for this are charges of “antisemitism”; that UCLA violated the civil rights of Jewish students. This alleges that the university was therefore out of compliance with the terms of grant funding, and thus the grants have been frozen while an investigation takes place. As a Jewish person, it disgusts me that the Trump Administration, [which is staffed by many people with ties to neo-nazis](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/14/nx-s1-5387299/trump-white-house-antisemitism) and subscribes to [replacement theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Replacement_conspiracy_theory), is using the well-being of Jews to attack bastions of learning, medicine, and knowledge. The same anti-immigrant rhetoric used every day by Trump and his followers is the same rhetoric that prevented Jews from escaping the holocaust and resulted in the systematic extermination of over 6 million Jewish people. This includes the vast majority of my paternal relatives. 

**Why is the Trump Administration going after universities and scientific funding?** Truth and the pursuit of knowledge are antithetical and a danger to demagogues and liars everywhere. This administration has made it clear through their actions and words: they are out to craft a world where they take as much as they can from everyone else to enrich themselves. Truth, critical thinking, and facts are the central danger for their movement to take our liberty, labor, and solidarity away from us. We must not waver in our commitment to the truth and each other.

**What does the funding freeze mean for UCLA?** UCLA gets ~20-30% of its revenue from external grants, ~$1 billion per year. Thus, this freeze, which is somewhere between $300-400 million, represents about a ten percent cut in revenue. The university will be looking to cut costs wherever it can, unfortunately. So that means things like building maintenance, administration, etc… will be cut. This might result in fewer inefficiencies in the long term, but will mean things will get harder to do in the short term. For example, maybe longer to fix problems in the buildings.

**What does this mean for our lab?** In some ways, we are still insulated from the brunt of this. I started at UCLA with $1.7 million in startup, of which we have spent ~$500,000 setting up the lab. I got a small grant of $100,000 from the BSCRC and until today had my R00 at ~$250,000/year. We have already initiated the process of moving expenses to my R00 for startup costs previous to this funding freeze. So, I think we are going to be okay. Barring UCLA clawing back my startup funds, I can cover everyone currently in the lab for five years. What this means that until this is resolved, we will probably grow at a slower rate than I had hoped. Having said that, I feel so incredibly lucky that I get to work with everyone who is currently in the lab right now. They are what make this lab so awesome.

**What can we do about it?** My time as a postdoc was marked by numerous crises. My postdoc advisor, Martin Kampmann, was an extremely stable presence during that time for the lab and for me personally. During times of crisis, he would say there are three steps:

1. Take a breath. Let the anxiety flow out of you. We are not at our best when we are reactionary. Especially as scientists, it is important to give ourselves the grace of thinking through problems in a rational way.

2. Reconnect with our values. When we act, it is important that we do not let crises take away who we are, and to act in concert with our values:

Belonging<br> 
Rigor<br>
Initiative<br>
Respect<br>
Curiosity<br>
Passion<br>

3. Support each other. When we are in times of crisis, it is important to stand up and stand with each other for whatever we need.

Only when we have done all three things can we act. So, here are some resources for action and support in these chaotic times:

[Union for Concerned Scientists](https://www.ucs.org/)<br>

Our unions (UAW for grad/postdoc and UPTE for technicians) will have good ways to get plugged into the fight to save science.

It is meaningful to me to participate in direction action locally, so here’s some local volunteering resources:<br>
