# Our research
The long-term goals of our research are to understand the large scale protein conformational changes that proteins undergo during aggregation– a protein's aggregation trajectory– and how different cell types control those trajectories. We take a protein energy landscape view of protein folding and misfolding and combine it with systems genetics techniques to gain a comprehensive view of how neurons control protein aggregation trajectories.
