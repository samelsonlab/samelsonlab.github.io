# Our research
The long-term goals of our research are to understand the large scale protein conformational changes that proteins undergo during aggregation—a protein's aggregation trajectory— and how cells control those trajectories. We take a protein energy landscape view of protein folding and misfolding and combine it with systems genetics techniques to gain a comprehensive view of how protein aggregation trajectories are controlled in neurodegeneration.
